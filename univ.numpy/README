	Create the displayed NumPy array without explicitly
	writing its values.
	[[ 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28]
        [ 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29]

	Suppose you want to evaluate the body mass index (BMI) of a group of people from their
	height and weight records. Knowing that each person's BMI is given by the quotient between
	their weight and the square of their height, implement all the tasks that follow, using the
	numpy package features.
	
	a) Create 2 arrays. The first one-dimensional, containing the names of a group of 10
	people, which will choose arbitrarily, and the other two-dimensional 2x10, with the
	weights and heights of those people, stored in their respective lines. In so that you do
	not have to enter all these values one by one, randomly generate them respecting the
	following constraints: all integer values; the weights should be between 50 and 100 kg;
	and heights between 150 and 200 cm.
	
	b) Calculate, and store in a new array, the body mass index of each person.

	c) Show how people are classified according to the following categories: "Lean" if
	BMI<18.5; “Fatty”="" se="" imc="">25; and "Normal" if 18.5≤BMI≤25</18.5;>.
	d) Show all people's attributes in ascending order of BMI.
	e) Show standard deviation of weights and heights.
	f) Show people weighing more than average.

	Create a NumPy 3x10 array, with actual random values, evenly distributed between 10 and 20
	(this one, exclusive). Then automatically identify the nearest value of 15 on each of the lines.
